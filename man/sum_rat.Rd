\title{Summarize Count and Calculate Ratio, and Optionally Filter by Ratio}
\usage{
sum_rat(data, ..., threshold = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble, typically grouped by one or more variables.}

\item{...}{One or more column names (unquoted or quoted) to group by.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value for filtering the ratio.
Default is 0.01
Only rows with \code{Ratio} greater than this value are returned.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\item{Count}{The number of rows in each group.}
\item{Sum}{The number of rows for the first grouping value.}
\item{Ratio}{The ratio of the count to the total count of all groups.}
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame and calculates the count of rows for each
user given group, then computes the ratio of the count to the total count across all groups.
The function also allows filtering the results based on a user-specified ratio threshold.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  Category = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C"),
  Subcategory = c("X", "Y", "X", "Y", "X", "Y"),
  Value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
)

sum_rat(df, Category, Subcategory, threshold = 0.2)
sum_rat(df, "Category", "Subcategory", threshold = 0.2)
